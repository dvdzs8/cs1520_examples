To gain a better understanding of React and state management, for this lab, you
should work through the official React guide to making a game of Tic-Tac-Toe:

https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

The change you should make from the instructions laid out there is with the
initialization and setup. To prepare you for using Vite on the projects,
you should work on this exercise by creating a new Vite app, and then do the
following:

- Move 03_App.jsx to overwrite the contents of src/App.jsx
- Move 03_index.css to overwrite the contents of src/index.css
- Remove src/App.css
- Remove the src/assets folder

From there, build and run your app using the Vite commands covered in lecture!
